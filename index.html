    <h2>The Problem</h2>

    <p>
      Java doesn't really have a good, easy to implement and start using, HTTP
      server. Those that do exist don't have easy access to all of the
      underlying data provided with an HTTP request. As such, we put together
      our own system for 
      <a href="http://storytellersoftware.com">Storyteller</a>, extracted the
      HTTP bits, and polished it up a whole bunch.
    </p>

    <h2>So... What is it?</h2>

    <p>
      This is a more polished version of the original underlying HTTP server
      used by Storyteller. By more polished, we mean that there's been a good
      deal of added features to make it easy for people to start using 
      quickly. The main goals of this server are to permit quick creation and 
      to provide users with a largely customizable system.
    </p>

    <h2>How can I use it?</h2>

    <p>
      That might be better answered in one of two places:
    </p>

    <ul>
      <li><a href="javadoc/index.html">java-httpserver's javadoc</a></li>
      <li><a href="tutorial.html">Our simple tutorial</a></li>
    </ul>

    <p>
      You'll also need Java 7, mostly because we use multi-catch blocks, which
      aren't supported before Java 7.
